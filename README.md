## Overview
The objective of this project is to build a functional front-end clone of Netflix, the popular video streaming platform, using modern web technologies. By leveraging HTML and CSS, the project establishes a visually appealing and responsive user interface that closely resembles the design of Netflix. The styling will include elements such as a dynamic landing page, feature-rich movie cards, responsive navigation menus, and category-based layouts.

React.js is used as the core JavaScript framework to create reusable and interactive UI components, enabling efficient rendering and a seamless user experience. Features like dynamic routing, state management, and component-based architecture will make the application scalable and maintainable. The project can be extended by integrating APIs (e.g., TMDB API) to fetch movie data dynamically, providing a realistic demonstration of working with external data sources.

 * Through this project, the goal is to practice and demonstrate modern web development skills, including:

 * Responsive and mobile-first design with CSS

 * Component-driven development with React.js

 * React Router for page navigation

 * API integration for dynamic movie data

 * Consistent and intuitive user experience

Overall, this Netflix clone project serves as an excellent exercise to build a robust, scalable, and visually appealing web application while strengthening proficiency in HTML, CSS, and React.js.
